## üéØ The Problem We Solve

**Traditional world-building barriers:**
- Requires deep technical expertise (3D modeling, coding, asset creation)
- Time-consuming pipeline (concept ‚Üí design ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí testing)
- Inaccessible to non-technical creators
- Solo creator bottleneck limits scale and complexity

### Our Solution:
**HorizonForge** dismantles these barriers by pairing human creativity with generative AI. We make professional-quality world design accessible to everyone, from solo creators to large development teams. We eliminate the "expert-only" barrier and empower creators at all skill levels.
