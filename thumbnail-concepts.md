## General Thumbnail Best Practices

**Typography:**
- **Font Family:** Montserrat Bold or Inter Bold (high legibility)
- **Text Limit:** 3–5 words maximum (viewers have 1–2 seconds)
- **Font Size:** Master file 1920x1080 = 60–100px per line
- **Text Shadow:** 4–6px drop shadow (dark color, 60% opacity) for legibility over images

**Color & Contrast:**
- Primary accent: #00D4FF (cyan) — use for call-to-action text
- Secondary accent: #6B46FF (purple) — use for supporting text or borders
- Background: Dark (#0F0F1F or near-black) to make content pop
- Ensure 7+ contrast ratio between text and background (WCAG AA compliant)

**Focal Point:**
- One strong visual center: avatar, glowing button, or feature highlight
- Use symmetry or rule-of-thirds to position elements
- Avoid cluttered layouts; white space is your friend

**Badges & Branding:**
- HorizonForge logo: Always include (ideally top-left, 100–120px)
- Meta Horizon Creator Competition badge: Bottom-right or corner (80–100px)
- URL: Small text, bottom-center or bottom-right (28–36px)

**File Specifications:**
- Master file: 1920x1080 (16:9), PNG format, RGB color space
- Export copies:
  - YouTube: 1280x720 (16:9) — compressed, under 500KB
  - Instagram Feed: 1080x1080 (1:1)
  - Instagram Reels: 1080x1920 (9:16)
  - LinkedIn: 1200x628 (16:9)
- All exports: sRGB color profile, 85% JPEG quality

## Recommended Production Order

**Priority 1 (Must-Have):**
- **Concept 1:** Avatar-focused (Synthesia primary) — largest impact for YouTube main thumbnail

**Priority 2 (High Value):**
- **Concept 3:** Interface-focused (VEED.IO primary) — alternative for A/B testing

**Priority 3 (Social/Bonus):**
- **Concept 2:** Social square (1:1) — repurpose for Instagram, LinkedIn
- **Concept 4:** Feature collage — alternative for YouTube or TikTok

## File Naming Convention

```
thumbnail_synthesia_avatar_16x9.png       (Concept 1 - Master)
thumbnail_synthesia_avatar_yt.png         (Concept 1 - YouTube export, 1280x720)
thumbnail_synthesia_avatar_ig_square.png  (Concept 2 - Instagram 1:1)
thumbnail_synthesia_avatar_ig_reel.png    (Concept 2 - Instagram Reels 9:16)

thumbnail_veedio_interface_16x9.png       (Concept 3 - Master)
thumbnail_veedio_interface_yt.png         (Concept 3 - YouTube export, 1280x720)

## Design Tips for Maximum CTR (Click-Through Rate)

1. **Use bright, contrasting colors:** Cyan and purple pop against dark backgrounds and adjacent YouTube thumbnails.
2. **Face/Avatar rule:** Include a human or avatar face to increase engagement by 30–50%.
3. **Text-to-image ratio:** 60% image, 40% text is ideal for scanability.
4. **Avoid red (unless critical):** YouTube's red play button already draws attention; use complementary colors.
5. **Test asymmetry:** Off-center layouts often outperform centered designs.
6. **Add motion cues:** If using static images, add directional elements (arrows, hands) to suggest interactivity.

## A/B Testing Recommendations

**Test Variation 1 (Control):** Concept 1 (Avatar-focused)
- Expected CTR baseline: 4–6% (typical for tech/VR content)

**Test Variation 2 (Alt):** Concept 3 (Interface-focused)
- Expected outcome: Compare CTR; interface may appeal to technical viewers
- Monitor which resonates with DevPost/creator audience

**Measurement:** Run each for 100–150 views, compare CTR. Keep higher performer for remaining campaign.
